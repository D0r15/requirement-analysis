# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and working example of the requirement analysis phase in the software development lifecycle. It aims to illustrate how to gather, document, and manage software requirements effectively before the design and implementation stages begin.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:

Demonstrate structured approaches to capturing both functional and non-functional requirements

Provide templates and examples of use cases, user stories, and personas

Offer tools for requirements traceability and change management

Serve as an educational reference for students, developers, and project stakeholders involved in early-stage software planning

Contents
Functional Requirements – What the system should do

Non-Functional Requirements – Performance, security, usability, etc.

Use Cases & User Stories – Real-world scenarios driving system behavior

Stakeholder Analysis – Identification and analysis of stakeholders

Requirements Traceability Matrix – Mapping requirements to implementation and testing

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures a shared understanding between the development team and stakeholders about what the system should do and how it should behave.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements: Define what the system should do (e.g., login, data processing).

Non-Functional Requirements: Define how the system should perform (e.g., speed, security).

Business Requirements: Outline the organization’s goals.

User Requirements: Describe what the end-user expects from the system.

System Requirements: Technical specifications the system must meet.

Process of Requirement Analysis
Requirement Elicitation: Gathering information through interviews, surveys, etc.

Requirement Analysis: Organizing and evaluating the collected data.

Requirement Specification: Documenting requirements clearly.

Requirement Validation: Confirming accuracy and completeness.

Requirement Management: Tracking changes throughout the project.

Importance in SDLC

Ensures alignment with business goals

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Defines Project Scope and Prevents Scope Creep
Requirement analysis helps clearly outline what the system should and shouldn’t do. This prevents scope creep—the uncontrolled expansion of project features—by setting clear boundaries from the beginning. A well-defined scope keeps the project focused and manageable.

2. Improves Communication Between Stakeholders
It acts as a bridge between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders (e.g., clients, users, managers). By translating business needs into technical requirements, it ensures everyone has a shared understanding of the goals and expectations, reducing confusion and rework.

3. Reduces Costs and Saves Time
Detecting errors or misunderstandings during the requirement phase is much cheaper and faster than fixing them during development or after deployment. Requirement analysis helps catch issues early, minimizing costly redesigns or delays.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering
Involves collecting initial information about the project from stakeholders.

Focuses on understanding the needs, expectations, and goals of users and clients.

May include studying existing systems, documents, and business processes.

Often serves as the starting point for deeper analysis.

2. Requirement Elicitation
Involves engaging directly with stakeholders to draw out detailed requirements.

Techniques include interviews, surveys, questionnaires, workshops, brainstorming, and observations.

Helps uncover both stated and hidden requirements.

Encourages stakeholder involvement to ensure completeness.

3. Requirement Documentation
Converts gathered and elicited information into a clear, structured format.

Typically results in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) or similar document.

Ensures all stakeholders can review, understand, and agree on what will be built.

Serves as a formal reference throughout the SDLC.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Involves examining documented requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness.

Identifies conflicts, gaps, or ambiguities.

May include modeling techniques like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), or user stories to visualize and structure requirements.

Helps developers and designers understand how different parts of the system will interact.

5. Requirement Validation
Ensures that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs.

Involves techniques such as reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping.

Confirms that requirements are testable and suitable for guiding development and quality assurance.

Seeks formal approval from stakeholders before moving to design.

# Types of Requirements.
1. Functional Requirements
Definition:
Functional requirements define the specific behaviors, functions, and features the system must perform. They describe what the system should do in response to inputs or situations.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:

Users should be able to create an account and log in securely.

The system should allow customers to search for available booking slots based on date, service type, and location.

Users should be able to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.

Admins should be able to view and manage all bookings, including assigning service staff.

The system should send email and SMS notifications upon successful booking, rescheduling, or cancellation.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
Definition:
Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform rather than what it should do. These include constraints and quality attributes like performance, usability, reliability, and security.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:

The system should load search results within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.

The platform should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

User data must be stored and transmitted using end-to-end encryption to ensure privacy and security.

The system should be available 99.9% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance.

The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for first-time users.

# Use Case Diagrams.
Definition:
A Use Case Diagram is a type of behavioral diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) that visually represents the functional requirements of a system. It shows how users (actors) interact with various functions (use cases) that the system offers.

Use case diagrams focus on what the system should do from the user's perspective, not how it is implemented.

Key Elements:

Actors: External entities that interact with the system (e.g., users, other systems).

Use Cases: Specific functions or services provided by the system (e.g., "Book Appointment", "Cancel Booking").

System Boundary: The scope of the system being modeled.

Relationships: Associations between actors and use cases (e.g., include, extend).

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
Clarify System Scope: Helps define what will be included in the system and what will not.

Improve Communication: Easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand, promoting better collaboration.

Identify System Functionality: Provides a clear, high-level overview of all the system’s functionalities from the user's perspective.

Support Requirement Gathering: Helps elicit and organize requirements during the early stages of development.

Guide Development and Testing: Serves as a reference for developers and testers to ensure all use cases are covered.

# Acceptance Criteria.
Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by the user, customer, or other stakeholders. They serve as a bridge between requirements and testing, clearly defining when a feature or functionality is considered “done.”

Why Acceptance Criteria Matter:
Clarify Requirements: They eliminate ambiguity by specifying exactly what must be implemented.

Improve Communication: Provide a shared understanding between developers, testers, and stakeholders.

Guide Development: Help developers stay focused on delivering value that meets business needs.

Enable Testing: Serve as the basis for writing test cases to verify that a feature works as expected.

Support Acceptance Testing: Allow stakeholders to confirm whether the delivered feature meets expectations.

Example: Acceptance Criteria for a Checkout Feature
Feature: Checkout functionality in a Booking Management System

Acceptance Criteria:

The user must be able to view a summary of their selected service(s), booking time, and total cost before confirming.

The system must allow payment via at least two methods (e.g., credit card and mobile payment).

The payment gateway must return a success or failure response within 10 seconds.

Upon successful payment, the system must generate a unique booking confirmation number.

The user must receive a confirmation email and SMS with booking details within 2 minutes of successful payment.

If payment fails, the user must receive an appropriate error message and be allowed to retry.
