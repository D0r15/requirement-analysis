# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and working example of the requirement analysis phase in the software development lifecycle. It aims to illustrate how to gather, document, and manage software requirements effectively before the design and implementation stages begin.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:

Demonstrate structured approaches to capturing both functional and non-functional requirements

Provide templates and examples of use cases, user stories, and personas

Offer tools for requirements traceability and change management

Serve as an educational reference for students, developers, and project stakeholders involved in early-stage software planning

Contents
Functional Requirements – What the system should do

Non-Functional Requirements – Performance, security, usability, etc.

Use Cases & User Stories – Real-world scenarios driving system behavior

Stakeholder Analysis – Identification and analysis of stakeholders

Requirements Traceability Matrix – Mapping requirements to implementation and testing

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures a shared understanding between the development team and stakeholders about what the system should do and how it should behave.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements: Define what the system should do (e.g., login, data processing).

Non-Functional Requirements: Define how the system should perform (e.g., speed, security).

Business Requirements: Outline the organization’s goals.

User Requirements: Describe what the end-user expects from the system.

System Requirements: Technical specifications the system must meet.

Process of Requirement Analysis
Requirement Elicitation: Gathering information through interviews, surveys, etc.

Requirement Analysis: Organizing and evaluating the collected data.

Requirement Specification: Documenting requirements clearly.

Requirement Validation: Confirming accuracy and completeness.

Requirement Management: Tracking changes throughout the project.
